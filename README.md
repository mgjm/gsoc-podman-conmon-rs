# Google Summer of Code:<br>Conmon-rs support for podman

> Running containers with podman using conmon-rs as the container monitor. This requires additional features to be implemented in conmon-rs and an extension of podman to use the new conmon-rs go client as an alternative to the existing conmon binary executable.

This repository is used to organize and schedule current tasks and milestones to be achieved. I develop the actual code in forked repositories, with the goal of merging them into the upstream projects.
